# Loan-Eligibility-prediction
Dream Housing Finance offers a range of home loans and operates across urban, semi-urban, and rural regions. When customers apply for a home loan, the company reviews their eligibility before approval.To improve this process, the company aims to automate loan eligibility checks in real-time using the information customers provide in their online application forms. These details include gender, marital status, education, number of dependents, income, loan amount, credit history, and other factors.The goal of this project is to help the company identify customer segments eligible for loans, allowing them to focus their efforts on these specific customers. For this purpose, they have shared a partial dataset to work on this problem.
